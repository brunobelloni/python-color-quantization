### Slower implementation of "The incremental online k-means clustering algorithm and its application to color quantization"

 ##### *Would be pretty much faster with numpy vectorized operations*

  1) Batch K-Means (Forgy, 1965 and Lloyd, 1982) (Not implemented yet)
  2) Incremental Batch K-Means (Linde et al., 1980) (Not implemented yet)
  3) Online K-Means (MacQueen, 1967)
  4) Incremental Online K-Means (Abernathy & Celebi, 2022)
